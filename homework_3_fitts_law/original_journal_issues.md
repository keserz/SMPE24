In the original journal several issue was found regarding the experimental explanation provided by the researcher [found on this link](https://gricad-gitlab.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/coutrixc/m2r_pointingxp/-/blob/main/journal.md?ref_type=heads)

**Below is a list of several issues**:

- Experimental setup
    - tools used
        - no mention of the device specification or model used to track the target acquisition
        - no mention of the display specification or model and resolution used
    - no mention of the distance between eyes and display
    - no mention of the lighting setup

- Demographic
    - Only one participant, outliers exist in most if not all experiments
    - No mention about the characteristic of the participant
        - age, gender, expertise with the pointing device, vision impairment, mobility impairment, reaction time at the moment of data collection

- Experimental task
    - what is the shape and size of the target
    - what is the unit of the "*width*" ?
    - what is the unit of the "*distance*" ?
    - what were the instructions the participant had to follow ?

Since websites may not remain accessible indefinitely, we risk losing crucial information about the participant's task. Without this, we wouldn’t know details like the shape of the target, its size (and unit), or the distance (and unit) to be covered.

- Order effect
An order effect may have influenced the results of this experiment, which is another reason why a single participant is insufficient to draw any meaningful conclusions.

- Data
The data does not align with the description provided in the author’s journal. In the journal, the author states: "*I ran the experiment from the above webpage with widths of 1, 2, and 4, and distances of 16, 32, and 64*." However, the data instead shows distances of 8, 16, and 32.
