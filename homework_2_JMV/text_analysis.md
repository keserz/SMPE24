In this paper, Karl Popper discusses a problem he began tackling in 1919: how to classify a theory as scientific. His goal was to distinguish between science and pseudo-science.

To illustrate this problem, he uses four different theories in his argument:
- Einstein's theory of relativity
- Marx's theory of history
- Freud's psychoanalysis
- Adler's psychology

In his investigation, Popper noticed a common feature in the last three theories: most experiments related to them seemed to be focused on finding confirmation. What struck him was that he couldn't find a scenario that could not be explained either by Adler's psychology or Freud's psychoanalysis. Both theories seemed to have an explanation for every possible case Popper could think of. However, Einstein's theory of relativity had a very different property. Some of the claims made by Einstein's work led to predictions about the movement and position of celestial objects, and these predictions could be tested. If observations based on Einstein's calculations, such as the position of a certain star at a given time, did not match the predictions, then his theory would be discarded. On the contrary, if the observations did match, his theory would be reinforced.

These two types of theories had fundamentally different approaches. Freud's and Adler's theories could explain everything, while Einstein's theory could not. If a star wasn’t at the predicted position, Einstein's theory had no explanation—meaning it could be disproved by observations that didn’t align with the predictions, whereas Freud's and Adler's theories couldn’t be refuted in the same way.

With this property of refutability in mind, Popper developed a list of criteria for classifying a theory as scientific:

1. Confirmations of a theory are easy to find if one looks for them, but they don’t make a theory scientific.
2. Confirmations should count only if they result from risky predictions.
3. A good scientific theory forbids certain things from happening.
4. A theory that cannot be refuted by any conceivable observation is non-scientific.
5. Genuine tests of a theory aim to refute it.
6. Confirming evidence should count only when it results from attempts to refute the theory.
7. Some theories are shielded from refutation by ad hoc modifications, which reduce their scientific status.
